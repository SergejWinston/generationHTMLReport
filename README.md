# Generation HTML

This repository contains a project that generates HTML documents using a Telegram bot. The project leverages the `telebot`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `sql_exec` libraries to produce HTML reports based on user inputs.

## Overview

The project includes two main files:
- `bot.py`: The main script that handles the Telegram bot's functionality.
- `template.html`: The HTML template used to generate the reports.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SergejWinston/generation_html.git
   cd generation_html
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables for the Telegram bot token.

## Usage

1. Start the bot:
   ```
   python bot.py
   ```

2. Interact with the bot on Telegram to generate HTML reports.

## File Descriptions

### `bot.py`

This script sets up a Telegram bot using the `telebot` library. It includes the following key functions:

- `removeprefix(s, prefix)`: Removes a specified prefix from a string.
- `deny(id)`: Sends an access denial message to a user.
- `generate_document(number)`: Generates an HTML document based on a template and user data.
- `gen_keyboard(arg)`: Generates an inline keyboard for the Telegram bot.
- `callback_query(call)`: Handles callback queries from the inline keyboard.
- `start_message(message)`: Sends a welcome message when the bot is started.

### `template.html`

This file serves as the template for generating HTML reports. It includes placeholders for user data such as name, photo, and notes. The template uses CSS for styling and includes links to Google Fonts for custom fonts.
